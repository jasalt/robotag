This (lack of) structure can be difficult to reason about and even more difficult to debug.</p>\n<p>Flux mandates unidirectional data flow. This directive is perhaps its defining characteristic.

Flux “stores” (<em>almost</em> analogous to “models”) do not allow outsiders to modify their state. By not exporting their “setters” they make these methods private to the store itself.

I struggled with the Fourier transform until I realized it was turning pressure to pitch or radiation to color. Insights like these are often making connections between something you do understand and the material you don’t.</p>\n<p>Debugging errors is also important because often you make mistakes because you’re missing knowledge or have an incorrect picture. A poor understanding is like a buggy software program. If you can debug yourself in an efficient way, you can greatly accelerate the learning process.</p>\n<p>Doing these two things, forming accurate connections and debugging errors, is most of creating a deep understanding.
